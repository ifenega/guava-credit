      <h4 class="font-semibold mb-4 underline">
        4. Disclosure and Consent to Electronic Communications
      </h4>
      You understand and agree that you are entering into these Terms of use
      electronically and that certain categories of information
      (“Communications”) may be provided by TarQ to you by electronic means
      (e.g., email, through the TarQ terms of use, or to your mobile device),
      unless and until you withdraw your consent as described below. The
      categories of Communications that may be provided by electronic means
      include:<br /><br />
      <p class="ml-6 sm:ml-12">
        these Terms of use and any amendments, modifications, or supplements;
        records of any payment and other transactions you handle through the
        TarQ services, including payment histories and transaction
        confirmations; disclosures or notices provided in connection with the
        TarQ services, including any required by federal or state law (including
        initial disclosures, periodic statements, periodic and annual error
        resolution notices, initial and annual privacy notices, opt-out notices,
        and change-in-terms notices); any customer use communications, including
        communications with respect to claims of error or unauthorized use of
        the TarQ uses; and any other communication related to the TarQ services.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      Although we reserve the right to provide Communications in paper format at
      any time, you agree that we are under no obligation to do so. All
      Communications in either electronic or paper format will be considered to
      be “in writing.” You should print a paper copy of these Terms of use and
      any Communication that is important to you and retain the copy for your
      records. If you do not wish to receive these Terms of use or the
      Communications electronically, you may not use any of the TarQ services.
      <br /><br />
      If you have opened an account with us and you wish to withdraw your
      consent to have Communications provided electronically, you must close
      your account by contacting support@gettarQ.com and stop using the TarQ.
      There are no fees to close your account with us. Any withdrawal of your
      consent to receive electronic Communications will be effective only after
      we have a reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal and only
      after all outstanding transactions have been settled.<br /><br />
      We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to discontinue the provision
      of your electronic Communications, or to terminate or change the terms and
      conditions on which we provide electronic Communications. We will provide
      you with notice of any such termination or change as required by law.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4 class="font-semibold mb-4 underline">5. Fees</h4>

      <h5 class="underline italic mb-4">Processing Fee</h5>
      Unless in a Fee-Free Transaction (defined below), you will be charged a
      flat fee (the “Processing Fee”) in the amount shown at the time you
      request your Advance from TarQ. The Processing Fee will be payable at the
      time of payment of your Advance. A "Fee-Free Transaction" will be one in
      which (i) you have requested the Advance to your TarQ Pre-paid Card, and
      have set up your direct deposit in accordance with the applicable terms;
      (ii) you are receiving a fee-free advance for a promotion or referral; or
      (iii) your employer has elected to pay for certain usage of our
      services.<br /><br />
      The Processing Fee is the charge for participating in TarQ’s (Earned Wage
      Access) EWA use, and it represents TarQ’s costs associated with processing
      your request. TarQ represents and warrants that you will not be required
      to pay any other charges or fees in connection with the use of EWA.<br /><br />
      <p class="font-semibold">
        The Processing Fee is not dependent on the amount that you request from
        TarQ. You incur the Processing Fee for each request of Advance that you
        make. We want you to get the most from our use, and so we recommend that
        you keep this in mind, for clear understanding. Two Advances of
        NGN100,000, for example, will cost twice as much as one advance of
        NGN200,000.<br /><br />
        We don’t enjoy charging you fees, and we want to minimize the amount you
        pay to get your Accrued Amount early. Please use our service in the way
        that’s best for you today and tomorrow.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

      <h4 class="underline italic mb-4">Additional Fees</h4>

      There are no additional fees for using the TarQ services.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4 class="font-semibold mb-4 underline">6. TarQ Services</h4>
      There are two services offered by TarQ
      <br /><br />
      1. Advance- accessible before distribution of accrued amount not exceeding
      50%.<br />
      2. Cumulative Advance- total Accrued Amount for a period not exceeding six
      months
      <br /><br /><br />
      Your right to access and use TarQ uses is personal to you and is not
      transferable by you to any other person or entity. You may only access and
      use the TarQ services for lawful purposes. TarQ has partnered with your
      Payroll Provider, employer, or both to provide you access to the TarQ
      services.
      <br /><br />
      <p class="font-semibold">
        You have no obligation to use the TarQ services. You have the right to
        wait until your regular payment due date without using the TarQ
        services. If you do choose to wait, you have the right to receive the
        full amount of your wages, without discount.
      </p>

      Upon distribution of your Advance/Cumulative Advance, you, or TarQ on your
      behalf, will notify your Payroll Provider that you have received the
      Advance. Such notice will represent your acknowledgment that you have
      received a portion of your Accrued Amount, and your authorization and
      direction for the Payroll Provider to distribute to TarQ an amount (the
      “Repayment”) equal to the Advance and the Processing Fee equal from your
      next Distribution and in the case of Cumulative Advance, the stipulated
      monthly Repayment over a specified period. You may revoke your
      authorization for any such subsequent deductions at any time without a
      penalty or a fee.
      <p class="font-medium">
        YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NOT ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED OR
        CONVEYED YOUR WAGES FROM EMPLOYER OR ANY PART THEREOF. TarQ HAS NO RIGHT
        TO ASSERT A CLAIM AGAINST YOU OR EMPLOYER WITH RESPECT TO YOUR WAGES AND
        HAS NO RIGHT, TITLE OR INTEREST IN, TO OR UNDER YOUR WAGES.
      </p>
      However, if TarQ is unable to settle an Advance transaction/, your access
      to the TarQ services may be limited or suspended until such time as you
      voluntarily pay the outstanding Repayment amount.<br /><br />
      When you elect to take an Advance, you will choose where to send the
      amount. This selection is made by you entering your applicable account
      information. TarQ has no ability to change or input your bank account or
      card information, and you are solely responsible for inputting the correct
      information. TarQ will only send the Advances to the bank account or card
      that you have entered into our system, so please ensure that the
      information you enter is correct. TarQ is not responsible for any
      information incorrectly entered by you.<br /><br />
      By using the TarQ services, you represent and warrant that the portion of
      the Accrued Amount that you are requesting to access is just and due to
      you, that this amount is not subject to reduction in whole or in part by
      reason of a valid lien or garnishment, and that by requesting an Advance,
      you have a reasonable expectation of receiving your Accrued Amount in your
      next scheduled Distribution. You acknowledge and agree that the Advance
      represents a portion of your Accrued Amount and, at the time your Employer
      makes a payment associated with such wages, the Repayment to TarQ plus
      your receipt of any remainder will constitute full and complete receipt of
      your wages.<br /><br />
      In the event that you have received an Advance, it may constitute fraud
      for you to notify your Payroll Processor or Employer that you have not
      received a portion of your Accrued Amount through your use of the TarQ
      services.
      <br /><br />
      <br /><br />
      <br /><br />
      TarQ uses a number of variables to determine your earned wages, which may
      include but is not limited to, earnings history, time and attendance data,
      and employer confirmation. In rare instances, the determination of your
      earned wages may be incorrectly calculated. As a result, our system may
      distribute an Advance that is in excess of your Accrued Amount. In such an
      event, you authorize such amounts to be deducted from your next following
      Distribution.
      <p class="underline">You may withdraw this authorization at any time.</p>
      For clarity, you will never incur additional fees as a result of doing so,
      and will not be charged any additional amounts.
      <p class="underline font-semibold">
        In the event that this would create any financial issue for you, please

      any of several reasons, including the malfunction of equipment, periodic
      updating, maintenance or repair of the TarQ use, or other actions that
      TarQ, in its sole discretion, may elect to take. In no event will TarQ be
      liable to any party for any loss, cost, or damage that results from any
      period of downtime of the Sites or uses.

      applicable fees, in our sole discretion and from time to time. In such
      event, if you are a subscriber to TarQ service, we will provide notice to
      you. If you do not agree to the changes after receiving a notice of the
      change to the TarQ services, you may stop using the TarQ services. Your
      use of the TarQ uses after you are notified of any change(s) will
